# Cyber Employment Report Summary

CSET, "Cybersecurity Employment Data: A Global Analysis" (2023), [PDF](https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0231_cyber_employment_report_EN.pdf).

- The global cybersecurity workforce numbers in the millions, yet demand exceeds supply by roughly three million roles.
- The United States and China each maintain large cyber labor pools but still report significant shortages.
- Financial services, government, and technology sectors dominate cyber employment across most economies.
- Expanding training pipelines, facilitating skilled immigration, and deepening publicâ€“private partnerships are recommended to address gaps.

These findings provide context for how adversaries might exploit capacity shortfalls when conducting influence or intelligence operations.
