## Current Objectives
- Map tactics, targets, and technologies used against UK and allied networks.
- Identify key actors, channels, and enabling infrastructure.
- Provide actionable insight for defenders and policy makers.

## Source Evaluation
Use only sources that meet at least one of the following:
- Official documents or datasets from verifiable institutions.
- Reputable media with transparent editorial standards.
- Peer-reviewed or expert publications.
- Information confirmed by two or more independent sources.

## Citation Style
`Author or Organization, "Title," Publication, Date, URL.` Include page numbers or timestamps when available.

## Open Questions & Future Work
- Quantify targeting beyond the UK.
- Verify the identity behind the persona "Chen-Lai."
- Catalog additional persona clusters and associated infrastructure.
- Assess long-term outreach patterns to high-value sectors.
- Evaluate export-control implications for VR/AR sensor companies and track misuse of open-source voice-cloning models.
- Examine how worldwide cybersecurity talent gaps, noted in CSET's [Cyber Employment Report](https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0231_cyber_employment_report_EN.pdf) and summarized [here](cyber_employment_report_summary.md), may open avenues for MSS influence operations.

## Internal Connector Use
- Prefix proprietary queries with `internal://`.
- Authenticate with assigned credentials at each session.
- Log all connector interactions and store retrieved documents in the secure archive.
