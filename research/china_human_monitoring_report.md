# China: manpower engaged in human monitoring

## A. Dedicated political-security professionals (core "political police")

- **MSS (Ministry of State Security)** – size is secret; credible public estimates run from the low hundreds of thousands up to ~600,000 employees (e.g., former U.S. official James Lewis told 60 Minutes "as many as 600,000"). [China News](https://www.chinanews.com.cn)

- **MPS Domestic Security Department (国保/DSD)** – the MPS’ political-security arm is present down to municipal level; numbers are not public but the unit’s function and priority are well documented. For estimation below, DSD is treated as a share of MPS sworn police (see B). [Leiden Asia Centre](https://leidenasiacentre.nl)

## B. Police & auxiliaries who do political monitoring as part of "stability maintenance" (维稳)

- **Sworn police (MPS)** – China does not publish a current national figure; historical and expert references place it around 2 million today (1.43 million in 2003; commonly cited ~2 million now). [观察者网](https://www.guancha.cn) [China Change](https://chinachange.org)

  - *Rationale*: 2003 MPS data showed 1.43m police; since then both population and police density rose, and academic work on Chinese policing uses ~2m as an order-of-magnitude anchor. [观察者网](https://www.guancha.cn) [Leiden Asia Centre](https://leidenasiacentre.nl)

- **Auxiliary police (辅警)** – para-police on local payrolls. ≥1.2 million nationwide by end-2024 (MPS data, reported); several provinces cap auxiliaries at or below the number of sworn police, with some local ratios up to 1.5 auxiliaries per officer. [chinascope.org](https://chinascope.org) [jxrd.jxnews.com.cn](https://jxrd.jxnews.com.cn) [chinapeace.gov.cn](https://www.chinapeace.gov.cn)

## C. Full-time neighborhood "grid" managers (网格员)

- **Grid workers** – ~4.5 million nationwide, per the PRC Ministry of Justice. They staff 583,000 "comprehensive governance centers" and act as eyes/ears for local Political-Legal Committees. [moj.gov.cn](https://www.moj.gov.cn)

## Bringing it together (headcount ranges)

- **Dedicated political-security** (MSS + DSD): very uncertain; a defensible working range = 300k–900k (MSS 100k–600k + a fraction of MPS assigned to DSD tasks). [China News](https://www.chinanews.com.cn) [Leiden Asia Centre](https://leidenasiacentre.nl)

- **Police & auxiliaries** (part-time political monitoring): ~3.2m (≈2.0m sworn + ≥1.2m auxiliaries), of whom only a share of time is political/security monitoring. [chinascope.org](https://chinascope.org) [China Change](https://chinachange.org)

- **Neighborhood grid managers** (full-time monitoring): ~4.5m. [moj.gov.cn](https://www.moj.gov.cn)

**Order-of-magnitude takeaway**: Counting people whose primary job is feeding, doing, or coordinating political/domestic surveillance (MSS + DSD + grid) yields ~5–9 million people (broad band because MSS and DSD headcounts are opaque). Including sworn/auxiliary police time spent on 维稳 duties, the labor applied to human monitoring on any given day plausibly sits well above 6 million FTEs (grid + dedicated units + a slice of police/aux time). The official 4.5 million grid workers alone make this an unusually manpower-intensive system by global standards. [moj.gov.cn](https://www.moj.gov.cn)

## China: what does this cost? (wage bill and budget anchors)

The central budget no longer itemizes all "domestic security" sub-lines. A floor wage bill can be estimated from units where wages are observable and checked against top-down "public security" budget aggregates.

### 1. Bottom-up "floor" wage bill (direct human monitoring)

- **Grid workers (~4.5m)** – public postings show monthly base pay typically ¥2,200–¥3,700 (examples from Hubei, Beijing Shunyi, Jinan). Annual wage bill ≈ ¥135–¥189 billion. [China Change](https://chinachange.org)

- **Auxiliary police (≥1.2m)** – often ¥3,300–¥5,000 RMB/month, higher in some cities (e.g., Guangdong/Jiangsu/Tianjin postings; Beijing positions approach ¥80k–97k/yr packages). Annual wage bill = ¥48–¥120+ billion at 1.2m auxiliaries (larger if closer to 2m). [Sohu](https://www.sohu.com) +1 [blog.sina.com.cn](https://blog.sina.com.cn)

- **MSS + MPS/DSD cadre** – no open wage data; illustrative bracket: if 300k–900k personnel average ¥120k–¥180k/yr, that's ¥36–¥162 billion in salaries (scenario calculation, not official). [Leiden Asia Centre](https://leidenasiacentre.nl) [China News](https://www.chinanews.com.cn)

→ **Conservative "floor" for wages directly tied to human monitoring labor**: ~¥230–¥470 billion per year (grid + auxiliaries + plausible band for MSS/DSD), before employer social contributions, housing funds, training, overhead, and equipment.

### 2. Top-down cross-check (domestic security budgets)

PRC "public security" (domestic) spending across all levels reached ¥702bn (2012) and ¥769bn (2013); by 2016 it exceeded ¥1 trillion, outpacing defense that year. Later budgets became harder to disaggregate publicly, but the level remaining ≥¥1T from the mid-2010s is well documented. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com) [Quartz](https://qz.com) [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com) [Jamestown](https://jamestown.org)

**Interpretation**: If total public-security outlays have been ≥¥1 trillion annually since 2016, a ¥230–¥470bn wage-only floor for the political-monitoring labor component is plausible and likely conservative, because it excludes many sworn police salaries (outside DSD time) and non-wage costs. Not all "public security" spend is political surveillance (it also funds ordinary policing, courts/jails in some classifications, etc.). [Jamestown](https://jamestown.org)

## Why tech hasn’t displaced people (the Xinjiang micro-case)

During the Xinjiang security surge, authorities added >90,000 police in 2016–2017 and rolled out 7,300+ checkpoints, even as high-tech systems expanded—clear evidence that technology scaled with headcount, not in place of it. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)

## Cross-country comparisons (how "manpower-heavy" is China?)

| Country / system | Core domestic-intelligence staff | Auxiliary / neighborhood "watchers" | Spend / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **China** | MSS: est. 100k–600k; MPS/DSD embedded nationwide | Grid workers ~4.5m; Aux. police ≥1.2m (regulatory caps allow more; some locales up to 1.5:1 aux:sworn) | Public security spend ≥¥1T since 2016; grid wages alone ~¥135–¥189bn/yr. [China News](https://www.chinanews.com.cn) [moj.gov.cn](https://www.moj.gov.cn) [chinascope.org](https://chinascope.org) [chinapeace.gov.cn](https://www.chinapeace.gov.cn) [Jamestown](https://jamestown.org) |
| **United States** | [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov) total positions ~37,000 (domestic intel/counterintelligence plus criminal) | No national grid; "fusion centers" exist but are small; local police not politically tasked | [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov) FY2025 budget ~$11.3B request. [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov) |
| **United Kingdom** | [MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk) "over 5,000 staff" | No mass neighborhood surveillance corps | UK intelligence funding via Single Intelligence Account ([MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk)/SIS/GCHQ); budget totals published but not [MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk)-only. [MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk) [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) |
| **Russia** | FSB numbers opaque; Rosgvardia ~340,000 internal troops | Some volunteer formations, but no nationwide "grid"; police staffing shortfalls ~172,000 recently signal overall scale; Rosgvardia underscores paramilitary role. | [The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com) [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com) |
| **Vietnam** | MPS domestic security organs; sizes not public | "Semi-specialized force" reportedly ~2,000,000 local security collaborators | Illustrates a PRC-style community-surveillance model in another one-party state. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) |
| **Cuba** | Small professional state security | CDR neighborhood committees ~8 million members (on paper; participation varies) | Longstanding model of mass citizen surveillance; largely volunteer. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) |
| **North Korea** | State Security & Social Security Ministries; 140k–210k public security personnel | Universal inminban units (20–40 households each) | The archetype of human-mesh surveillance. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) [38 North](https://www.38north.org) |

**What the table shows**: Democracies concentrate domestic-intelligence manpower in small professional agencies (thousands to tens of thousands). Authoritarian systems add or prioritize mass neighborhood networks (millions) to observe and feed information—China’s grid (~4.5m) is the standout contemporary example. [moj.gov.cn](https://www.moj.gov.cn)

## How I computed China's cost & manpower (at a glance)

1. **Count what's published**: grid workers 4.5m (official); auxiliaries ≥1.2m (MPS data reported); sworn police ~2.0m (historical/academic anchoring); MSS unknown → use a range tied to credible public estimates. [moj.gov.cn](https://www.moj.gov.cn) [chinascope.org](https://chinascope.org) [观察者网](https://www.guancha.cn) [China Change](https://chinachange.org) [China News](https://www.chinanews.com.cn)

2. **Wage floor from postings**: grid ¥2.2–3.7k/month, aux ~¥3.3–5.0k/month (higher in Tier-1 cities). Multiply by headcount × 12 (excludes social insurance, overtime, uniforms, vehicles, training). [Sohu](https://www.sohu.com) [blog.sina.com.cn](https://blog.sina.com.cn)

3. **Cross-check against the macro budget**: PRC public-security spend ≥¥1T since 2016—comfortably above the wage floor for monitoring labor, with room for overhead and technology. [Jamestown](https://jamestown.org)

## Uncertainty & what would most change the estimate

- MSS/DSD headcount and pay are the biggest missing pieces; a credible leak or MOF functional-line breakout would tighten the range substantially. [Leiden Asia Centre](https://leidenasiacentre.nl)

- Auxiliary police totals: MPS has acknowledged ≥1.2m; several provinces’ caps imply a theoretical upper bound near parity with sworn police (or higher). If auxiliaries are closer to 2–3m nationwide—as some local ratios suggest—the wage bill rises by ¥50–180bn. [chinascope.org](https://chinascope.org) [jxrd.jxnews.com.cn](https://jxrd.jxnews.com.cn) [chinapeace.gov.cn](https://www.chinapeace.gov.cn)

- Grid-worker pay varies with locality; moving the national median by ±¥500/month shifts the wage bill by about ±¥27bn.

## Bottom line

Manpower applied to human monitoring in China is measured in the millions—~5–9 million if you count MSS/DSD and the nationwide grid alone, and >6 million FTEs when you account for police/auxiliary time on 维稳. The unique driver is the grid management system (网格化治理), not technology. [moj.gov.cn](https://www.moj.gov.cn)

Annual labor cost for this monitoring—on a conservative wage-only basis—is likely in the low hundreds of billions of RMB (≈¥230–¥470bn), and plausibly higher once you include social charges and overhead embedded in the broader ≥¥1T public-security outlays. [Jamestown](https://jamestown.org)

Compared with peers, China’s system relies far more on mass human networks than on a compact professional cadre—closer in spirit to Cuba’s CDRs or Vietnam’s local security collaborators than to the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov)/[MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk) model in democracies.
