# China Human Monitoring Report

## Manpower
- China's domestic political surveillance still depends heavily on human personnel from the Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of Public Security, with grid-style neighborhood monitors supplementing digital tools.[1]
- Academic assessments estimate hundreds of thousands of community-level "stability maintenance" officers are tasked with reporting dissent and monitoring local activity.[2]

## Budget Estimates
- Public budget data indicates that China's domestic security expenditures reached roughly 1.4 trillion yuan (about USD $200 billion) in 2023, surpassing official military spending.[3]
- Provincial governments allocate additional funds for neighborhood committees and security contractors, making precise national totals difficult to verify.[4]

## Technology vs. Manpower
- Despite large investments in cameras, facial recognition, and big-data analytics, experts note that technology augments but does not replace the need for human surveillance teams.[1]
- AI-enabled systems often flag individuals for further investigation, but human officers still conduct interviews, site visits, and evidence collection.[5]

## Cross-Country Comparisons
- China's estimated per-capita spending on internal security significantly exceeds that of liberal democracies such as the United States and Germany, where legal constraints limit the scale of domestic monitoring.[3][6]
- Russia and Iran rely on similar human-led security architectures, though their budgets remain far smaller than China's, limiting nationwide coverage.[7]
