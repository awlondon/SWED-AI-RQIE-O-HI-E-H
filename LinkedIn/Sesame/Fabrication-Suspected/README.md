# Fabrication-Suspected LinkedIn Profiles

This directory contains subfolders for personas believed to be AI-fabricated. Each profile includes:

- `*_profile_full.png` â€“ screenshot of the full LinkedIn profile image.
- Feature crops such as `eyes.png` or `nose.png` and their corresponding `*_AIDR.png` overlays highlighting anomalies found by the AI-image-detection pipeline (AIDR).
- Images may contain embedded text captured through OCR.

Summary statistics and probabilities derived from these AIDR outputs are tracked in `RESULTS.md`.
