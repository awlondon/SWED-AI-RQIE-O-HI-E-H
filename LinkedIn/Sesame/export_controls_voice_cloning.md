# Export Controls and Voice Cloning Assessment

## Zinn Labs and Sesame AI
- Zinn Labs develops low-power gaze and attention tracking for VR/AR, using event cameras and IR lighting to compute gaze depth and pupil orientation.
- In 2025, its founders announced the team had joined Sesame AI, a U.S. startup building lightweight AI glasses and conversational models.

## U.S. Export Controls
- Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) rules currently focus on restricting high-performance AI chips and military technologies.
- Neither Zinn Labs nor Sesame appears on the U.S. Entity List, and their eye-tracking patents describe commercially available components.
- Companies shipping sensors or software to China must still consider end-use screening, but no specific export ban targets Zinn Labs technologies.

## MSS Front Company Theory
- Public records show Sesame founded in San Francisco in 2023 with funding from U.S. venture firms and leadership from known Oculus alumni.
- The idea that the Chinese Ministry of State Security created Sesame to bypass export controls lacks evidence; investor due diligence and open research make the claim speculative.

## Voice Cloning Risks
- AI voice models can clone a voice from seconds of audio, enabling scams where attackers impersonate executives or relatives to request money or data.
- Sesame released a 1B-parameter Conversational Speech Model under Apache 2.0 that can replicate voices with roughly one minute of source audio.
- Ethical guidelines discourage misuse, yet open-source releases mean other actors could adapt the technology for impersonation.

## Potential CCP Applications
- Voice clones combined with translation and call spoofing could aid social-engineering, espionage, or propaganda by mimicking foreign leaders or dissidents.
- Domestically, cloned voices might support surveillance or coercion if integrated into China's existing monitoring systems.

## Detainment and Identity Speculation
- Reports describe Chinese exit bans preventing some foreigners from leaving the country, but no evidence indicates Sesame staff have been detained or coerced.
- Claims that the MSS controls Sesame personnel or has stolen their identities remain unsubstantiated.
