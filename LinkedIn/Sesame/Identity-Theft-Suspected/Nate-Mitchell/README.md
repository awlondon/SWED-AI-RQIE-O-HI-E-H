# Nate Mitchell – Suspected Identity Theft

Screenshots here capture Google and Reddit search results, a Forbes reference, a private Instagram page and an X profile for the real Nate Mitchell. They also show ties to fellow Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe. The LinkedIn account examined may be exploiting these images, pointing to possible identity theft and loosely linking Mitchell with Sesame. OCR on these screenshots can surface additional metadata.

For broader context within the Sesame cluster, see the [parent README](../README.md).
