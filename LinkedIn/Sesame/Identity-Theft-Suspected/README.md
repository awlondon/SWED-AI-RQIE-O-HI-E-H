# Identity-Theft-Suspected LinkedIn Profiles

Evidence in this directory indicates that certain LinkedIn accounts may reuse photographs of real individuals without consent. Subfolders document each potential victim and include screenshots of search results, social media pages, or other public sources. Many images carry OCR-extractable text for further analysis.

## Suspected personas
- **Brendan Iribe** – Google search results, profile screenshots, and Instagram posts appear reused by a LinkedIn persona impersonating the Oculus co-founder and associating him with Nate Mitchell.
- **Gordon Wetzstein** – A Stanford professor whose photo is lifted for a LinkedIn profile; he co-founded Zinn Labs, reportedly acquired by Sesame, and is believed to be on sabbatical until April 2026.
- **Nate Mitchell** – Search results, a Forbes mention, and social media profiles mirror a LinkedIn account that may exploit his images while loosely linking him with Sesame.

All three names surface in open-source searches alongside Sesame, supporting the identity-theft suspicion.
