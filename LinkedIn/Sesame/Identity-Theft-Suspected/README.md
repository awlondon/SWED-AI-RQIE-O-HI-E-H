# Identity-Theft-Suspected LinkedIn Profiles

Evidence in this directory indicates that certain LinkedIn accounts may reuse photographs of real individuals without consent. For broader navigation of the project, see the parent [LinkedIn README](../../README.md). Subfolders document each potential victim and include screenshots of search results, social media pages, or other public sources. Many images carry OCR-extractable text for further analysis.

## Suspected personas
- **Brendan Iribe** – Google search results, profile screenshots, and Instagram posts appear reused by a LinkedIn persona impersonating the Oculus co-founder and associating him with Nate Mitchell.
- **Gordon Wetzstein** – A Stanford professor whose photo is lifted for a LinkedIn profile; he co-founded Zinn Labs, reportedly acquired by Sesame, and is believed to be on sabbatical until April 2026.
- **Nate Mitchell** – Search results, a Forbes mention, and social media profiles mirror a LinkedIn account that may exploit his images while loosely linking him with Sesame.

All three names surface in open-source searches alongside Sesame, supporting the identity-theft suspicion.
