# Brendan Iribe – Suspected Identity Theft

This folder holds Google search results, Google profile screenshots and Instagram posts linked to Brendan Iribe. Several images show Iribe with fellow Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell, reinforcing their association. The LinkedIn persona under review appears to reuse these public images, suggesting the account may impersonate the Oculus co-founder. Open-source queries also pair Iribe’s name with Sesame, albeit loosely. Embedded text in the screenshots can be extracted via OCR for deeper investigation.

For broader context within the Sesame cluster, see the [parent README](../README.md).
