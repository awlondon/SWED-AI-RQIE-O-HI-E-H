Chinese connections in the LinkedIn/Sesame/Identity‑Theft‑Suspected/Gordon‑Wetzstein folder
Background from the repository

The LinkedIn/Sesame/Identity‑Theft‑Suspected folder in the MSS LinkedIn investigation repository contains a sub‑folder for Gordon Wetzstein, a Stanford professor whose photograph appears to have been reused in a suspicious LinkedIn profile. The README in this folder notes that Wetzstein co‑founded Zinn Labs and states that the company was acquired by Sesame (the AI firm suspected of being a front for China’s Ministry of State Security)
raw.githubusercontent.com
. Another README in the parent directory reiterates that his photo is used without consent and that he co‑founded Zinn Labs, which was “reportedly acquired by Sesame”
raw.githubusercontent.com
. Wetzstein’s official Stanford biography confirms this acquisition, listing his role as Co‑founder & Chief Scientist, Zinn Labs (acquired by Sesame AI)
stanford.edu
. These files indicate that Zinn Labs’ acquisition by Sesame ties Wetzstein’s identity to an MSS‑linked Chinese tech firm.

Research connections with Chinese institutions and researchers

The folder includes several .url files pointing to Wetzstein’s recent research papers. Two of these papers – “Video World Models with Long‑term Spatial Memory” (2025) and “LayerPano3D: Layered 3D Panorama for Hyper‑Immersive Scene Generation” (2024–2025) – are authored by Wetzstein together with researchers from Chinese universities and labs. These papers provide concrete examples of collaborations connecting the Stanford professor to Chinese institutions:

Who are the Chinese collaborators?

Tong Wu – a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford working with Gordon Wetzstein; she earned her PhD at the Multi‑Media Lab (MMLab) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong and previously studied at Tsinghua University
wutong16.github.io
. She collaborates closely with Ziwei Liu at NTU and continues to work with Wetzstein on several papers
wutong16.github.io
.

Shuai Yang – affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory; he co‑authors both the Video World Models and LayerPano3D papers. These institutions are major Chinese research centers in AI

.

Yinghao Xu – a Stanford‑affiliated co‑author but of Chinese origin; he is part of Wetzstein’s team and contributes to the Video World Models paper
arxiv.org
.

Ziwei Liu – a faculty member at S‑Lab, Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) with ties to Chinese AI research; he collaborates with Wetzstein on the 2025 paper
spmem.github.io
.

Dahua Lin – a professor at CUHK and director of the Shanghai AI Laboratory; he supervises several of Wetzstein’s Chinese collaborators and co‑authors both papers
spmem.github.io
.

Jing Tan, Mengchen Zhang and Yixuan Li – graduate students or researchers at Chinese institutions (CUHK or Shanghai Jiao Tong University); they co‑author the LayerPano3D paper with Wetzstein

Summary of Chinese connections

Corporate link: The repository’s README states that Gordon Wetzstein co‑founded Zinn Labs, which was acquired by Sesame AI
raw.githubusercontent.com
. The parent README reiterates this acquisition
raw.githubusercontent.com
, and Wetzstein’s official CV confirms that Zinn Labs was acquired by Sesame AI
stanford.edu
. Sesame AI is suspected in the repository to be a Chinese MSS‑front company, linking Wetzstein’s former startup to Chinese state‑aligned interests.

Research collaborations: Wetzstein’s recent publications show extensive collaboration with Chinese researchers. The 2025 Video World Models paper lists Tong Wu, Shuai Yang, Yinghao Xu, Ziwei Liu and Dahua Lin as co‑authors
arxiv.org
 and notes that the work involves Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai AI Laboratory, CUHK and NTU
spmem.github.io
. Similarly, the 2024–2025 LayerPano3D paper includes Shuai Yang, Jing Tan, Mengchen Zhang, Tong Wu, Yixuan Li, Ziwei Liu and Dahua Lin among its authors
arxiv.org
. These collaborations demonstrate sustained ties between the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab and leading Chinese AI laboratories.

Academic pipeline: Biographical information for Tong Wu shows the academic pipeline linking Chinese institutions to Wetzstein’s lab. Wu obtained her PhD from CUHK’s MMLab, works closely with Ziwei Liu at NTU, and now serves as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford under Wetzstein
wutong16.github.io
. This trajectory underscores the flow of talent and collaboration between Chinese AI groups and Stanford.

In summary, the files in LinkedIn/Sesame/Identity‑Theft‑Suspected/Gordon‑Wetzstein highlight not only identity theft concerns but also document Wetzstein’s connections to Chinese entities. His startup Zinn Labs was purchased by Sesame AI
raw.githubusercontent.com
stanford.edu
, and his cutting‑edge research papers are co‑authored with numerous Chinese scholars from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, CUHK, Shanghai AI Laboratory and NTU’s S‑Lab
spmem.github.io
arxiv.org
. These collaborations, while academically productive, are notable in the context of the repository’s investigation into MSS‑linked infiltration and highlight cross‑border ties that could be exploited by malicious actors.
