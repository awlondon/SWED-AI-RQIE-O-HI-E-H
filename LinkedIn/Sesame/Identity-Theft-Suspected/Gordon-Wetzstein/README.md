# Gordon Wetzstein – Suspected Identity Theft

Contains a single photo (`IMG_7370.png`) believed to show the real Gordon Wetzstein. The LinkedIn profile in question likely reuses this image without authorization, indicating a stolen identity scenario. Wetzstein co-founded Zinn Labs, reportedly acquired by Sesame, and is currently unreachable—possibly on sabbatical in a remote area until April 2026. Any text embedded in the image can be extracted with OCR tools.
