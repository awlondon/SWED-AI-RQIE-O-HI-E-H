# Sesame Persona Investigation

This folder consolidates evidence on LinkedIn accounts linked to the company "Sesame" and suspected of using fabricated or stolen identities.

## Key Items
- `LinkedIn_HelpAssistant_Chat.pdf` and `LinkedIn_HelpAssistant_Chat_1.png`–`LinkedIn_HelpAssistant_Chat_7.png` – screenshots of a support conversation documenting attempts to flag the accounts.
- `Fabrication-Suspected/` – profiles believed to be AI-generated, with image-analysis artifacts.
- `Identity-Theft-Suspected/` – personas (e.g., Brendan Iribe, Gordon Wetzstein, Nate Mitchell) that appear to reuse real individuals' images without consent.
- `Zinn-Labs (acquisition)/` – open-source material on Sesame's reported acquisition of Zinn Labs.
- `event-based-gaze-risk-report.md` – summary of event-based gaze tracking threats and mitigations.
- `export_controls_voice_cloning.md` – assessment of export restrictions, MSS-front speculation, and voice-cloning risks tied to Sesame and Zinn Labs.

Current findings indicate no U.S. export ban on Zinn Labs' eye-tracking technology and no credible evidence that Sesame acts as an MSS front. However, open-source voice models could still be misused for impersonation or social engineering.
