# LinkedIn Investigations

Evidence and reports related to LinkedIn personas suspected of MSS involvement.

## Structure
- `Ankaa_Intel_Report__08.20.25.md` – background on MSS adoption of AI.
- `Sesame/` – artifacts for the "Sesame" persona cluster, including suspected identity theft, fabrication cases, and analyses of export controls and voice cloning.

New persona clusters should be added as subdirectories containing raw exports, screenshots, and analytic notes. Include a README in each folder summarizing key findings and source links.

## Future Work
- Map relationships between clusters and underlying infrastructure.
- Track account takedowns and resurrected identities.
- Compare LinkedIn behavior with presence on other platforms.
