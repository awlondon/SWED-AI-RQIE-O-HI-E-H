# LinkedIn Investigations

Evidence and reports related to LinkedIn personas suspected of MSS involvement.

For guidance on ongoing analytic tasks, see the [LinkedIn Infiltration Research Plan](../Intelligence-Analyst/LinkedIn_Infiltration_Research_Plan.md).

## Structure
- `Sesame/` – artifacts for the "Sesame" persona cluster, including suspected identity theft, fabrication cases, and analyses of export controls and voice cloning.

New persona clusters should be added as subdirectories containing raw exports, screenshots, and analytic notes. Include a README in each folder summarizing key findings and source links.

## Case Studies
- [Kevin Mallory](../case-studies/kevin-mallory/README.md) – contacted by a Chinese agent via LinkedIn and later convicted under the Espionage Act.
- [Yanjun Xu](../case-studies/yanjun-xu/README.md) – leveraged talent-recruitment programs and front companies to solicit aviation experts.
- [Chen Lai](../case-studies/chen-lai/notes.md) – ongoing research into recruitment methods and operational timeline.

## Related Institutions
- [Tsinghua University](../institutions/tsinghua-university/README.md) – recurring affiliation in fabricated LinkedIn profiles.
- [UCLA](../institutions/ucla/README.md) – prominent U.S. institution cited in suspicious resumes.
- [USC](../institutions/usc/README.md) – another common reference point in suspect educational histories.

## Supporting Resources
- [Datasets](../datasets/) – structured records like fake profiles and indictments help validate suspicious personas and spot activity patterns.
- [Shell Companies](../shell-companies/) – documentation on automation vendors exposes infrastructure enabling coordinated fake LinkedIn profiles.

## Future Work
- Map relationships between clusters and underlying infrastructure.
- Track account takedowns and resurrected identities.
- Compare LinkedIn behavior with presence on other platforms.
