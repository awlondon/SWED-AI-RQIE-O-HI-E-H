# Style Guide

This project uses a consistent citation format and narrative structure to keep reports clear and verifiable.

## Citation Format
- Use Markdown footnotes or inline links.
- Provide author, title, publication, and date when available.
- Include direct URLs and access dates for online sources.
- Number footnotes sequentially and list them at the end of the document.

## Narrative Structure
1. **Summary** – one‑paragraph overview of key findings.
2. **Background** – context on actors, technology, or events.
3. **Analysis** – evidence, reasoning, and methodology.
4. **Implications** – why the findings matter.
5. **Sources** – bibliography or footnotes supporting the narrative.

Follow this structure for case studies, reports, and other analytical documents.
