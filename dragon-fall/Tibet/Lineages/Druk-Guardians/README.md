# Druk Guardians

Monastic defenders serving the thunder dragon (*druk*) within the Drukpa tradition. They are credited with summoning storms to protect Himalayan passes.[^1]

Their weather rites resonate with India's [NƒÅga Kingdoms](../../../India/Lineages/Naga-Kingdoms/README.md) and sky-serpent ceremonies of Mesoamerican [Feathered Serpent Priests](../../../Mesoamerica/Lineages/Feathered-Serpent-Priests/README.md).[^2]
