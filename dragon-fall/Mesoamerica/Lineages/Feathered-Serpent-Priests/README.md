# Feathered Serpent Priests

Orders serving Quetzalcoatl and Kukulkan, blending avian and serpentine traits to mediate winds and rains.[^1]

Their weather-working role aligns with India's [Nāga Kingdoms](../../../India/Lineages/Naga-Kingdoms/README.md) and Tibet's [Druk Guardians](../../../Tibet/Lineages/Druk-Guardians/README.md).[^2]
