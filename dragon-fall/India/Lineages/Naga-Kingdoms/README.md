# Nāga Kingdoms

Dynasties claiming descent from serpents such as Vasuki and Shesha, guarding river crossings and mediating rainfall rituals.[^1]

Their riverine guardianship mirrors Japan's [Ryūjin Descendants](../../../Japan/Lineages/Ryujin-descendants/README.md) and the sky‑serpent role of Mesoamerican [Feathered Serpent Priests](../../../Mesoamerica/Lineages/Feathered-Serpent-Priests/README.md).[^2]
