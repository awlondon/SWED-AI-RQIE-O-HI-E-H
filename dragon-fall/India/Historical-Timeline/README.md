# Dragon Events Timeline – India

- c. 1500 BCE: Indra defeats the serpent Vṛtra, releasing the waters and establishing the monsoon cycle, a myth parallel to Japan's [Susanoo vs Orochi](../../Japan/Historical-Timeline/README.md).[^1]
- 2nd century BCE: Nāga worship spreads under the Mauryas; legends credit serpent kings with raising massive stupas, akin to feats speculated at [Stonehenge](../../megaliths/Stonehenge.md).[^2]
- 12th century CE: The Hoysala dynasty enshrines nāga guardians in temple gateways, practices echoed by [Ryūjin-descended clans](../../Japan/Lineages/Ryujin-descendants/README.md).[^3]
