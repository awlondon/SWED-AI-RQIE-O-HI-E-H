# Dragon Events Timeline – Japan

- c. 8th century CE: Susanoo slays the eight-headed serpent Yamata no Orochi, rescuing Kushinada-hime.[^1]
- 1185 CE: Taira naval forces at Dan-no-ura invoke sea dragons for aid, paralleling rain-making nāga rites in [India's timeline](../../India/Historical-Timeline/README.md).[^2]
- c. 8000 BCE (speculative): Submerged terraces near Yonaguni suggest ancient stonework tied to sea dragons; see [Yonaguni Monument](../../megaliths/Yonaguni-Monument.md).[^3]
