# Ryujin Descendants

Maritime clans claiming descent from Ryūjin, the dragon god of the sea. These families guarded coastal routes and offered pearls to the imperial court.[^1]

Parallels exist with India's [Nāga Kingdoms](../../../India/Lineages/Naga-Kingdoms/README.md) and Mesoamerica's [Feathered Serpent Priests](../../../Mesoamerica/Lineages/Feathered-Serpent-Priests/README.md), who similarly mediate between water and sky realms.[^2]
