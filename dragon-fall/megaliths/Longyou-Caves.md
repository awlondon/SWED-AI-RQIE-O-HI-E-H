# Longyou Caves

Zhejiang, China; hand-carved caverns dated around the 2nd century BCE with unknown purpose.[^1]

## Dragon-Fall speculation
Earth dragons carved the chambers with claws, echoing nƒÅga grottoes in [India](../India/Historical-Timeline/README.md) and refuges of Tibet's [Druk Guardians](../Tibet/Historical-Timeline/README.md).
