# Stonehenge

Wiltshire, England; constructed between 3000–2000 BCE. Mainstream archaeology views the stone circle as a ritual observatory.[^1]

## Dragon-Fall speculation
Isle dragons lifted the sarsen stones and fused lintels with fiery breath, echoing nāga‑assisted stupas in [India](../India/Historical-Timeline/README.md).
