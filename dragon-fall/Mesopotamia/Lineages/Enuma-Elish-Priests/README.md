# Enuma Elish Priests

Temple scholars who recited the *Enuma Elish* during the Akitu festival, preserving Marduk's triumph over Tiamat and claiming spiritual lineage from dragon‑slaying heroes.[^1]

Their ritual authority parallels the storm-invoking [Druk Guardians](../../../Tibet/Lineages/Druk-Guardians/README.md) and Mesoamerica's [Feathered Serpent Priests](../../../Mesoamerica/Lineages/Feathered-Serpent-Priests/README.md).[^2]
