# MSS LinkedIn Infiltration Investigation

This repository collects open-source intelligence on suspected operations run by China's Ministry of State Security (MSS). The investigation focuses on long-term infiltration of professional networks on LinkedIn using fake or stolen identities and AI-generated content.

## Repository Structure

- `LinkedIn/Ankaa_Intel_Report__08.20.25.txt` – background dossier describing MSS integration of AI into surveillance, cyber operations, and influence campaigns.
- `LinkedIn/Sesame/` – image fragments, facial-analysis outputs, and other evidence tied to a set of suspicious LinkedIn personas associated with the company "Sesame".
- Additional folders will cover other targets under review, including technology firms such as Auger.

## Goals

1. Document patterns of synthetic or stolen identities used to build trust over long periods.
2. Track potential corporate targeting and network infiltration.
3. Support wider research into state-sponsored information operations and counter-intelligence.
