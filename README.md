# MSS LinkedIn Infiltration Investigation

This repository collects open-source intelligence on suspected operations run by China's Ministry of State Security (MSS). The investigation focuses on long-term infiltration of professional networks on LinkedIn using fake or stolen identities and AI-generated content.

## Potential Activities

- Catalog suspicious LinkedIn accounts and associated artifacts.
- Perform image and text analysis to detect synthetic media or stolen credentials.
- Map relationships between accounts and track outreach behavior over time.
- Correlate findings with public records and breach data.
- Share research methods and evidence for peer review.

## Objectives

- Understand how MSS-directed campaigns leverage professional platforms.
- Identify tactics used to build credibility and manipulate targets.
- Provide resources for defenders to recognize and counter infiltration.
- Encourage transparency and information sharing across research communities.

## Repository Structure

- `LinkedIn/Ankaa_Intel_Report__08.20.25.txt` – background dossier describing MSS integration of AI into surveillance, cyber operations, and influence campaigns.
- `LinkedIn/Sesame/` – image fragments, facial-analysis outputs, and other evidence tied to a set of suspicious LinkedIn personas associated with the company "Sesame".
- `Grok_MSS_AI_Development_Report.md` – summary of a Grok report on MSS strategies for acquiring and applying AI.
- Additional folders will cover other targets under review, including technology firms such as Auger.

## Goals

1. Document patterns of synthetic or stolen identities used to build trust over long periods.
2. Track potential corporate targeting and network infiltration.
3. Support wider research into state-sponsored information operations and counter-intelligence.
