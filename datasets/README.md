# Datasets

This directory stores structured datasets used by the project.

## Schema

Both CSV and JSON datasets should use the following fields:

- `profile_id`: Unique identifier for a profile or record.
- `sector`: The sector or industry related to the entry.
- `source`: Origin of the data (e.g., OSINT, report, internal).

CSV files must include a header row with these columns. JSON files should contain an array of objects with these keys.

## Files

- `fake_profiles.csv` – records of suspected synthetic or compromised profiles.
- `indictments.csv` – legal indictment information linked to MSS activities.
- `analysis_summary.md` – counts of records by sector for each dataset (generated by `python scripts/analyze_datasets.py`).

Use `python scripts/update_datasets.py <file> <profile_id> <sector> <source>` to append new records and rerun `python scripts/analyze_datasets.py` to refresh the summary.
