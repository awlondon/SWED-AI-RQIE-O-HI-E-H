# Datasets

Structured data supporting analysis lives here.

## Standard Schema
Most CSV and JSON datasets use the following fields:

- `profile_id`: Unique identifier for a profile or record.
- `sector`: Industry or target sector linked to the entry.
- `source`: Origin of the data (e.g., OSINT, report, internal).

CSV files require a header row; JSON files should be arrays of objects with these keys. Some
specialized datasets define alternate schemas, which are documented in their file descriptions
below.

### MCF Institution Partnerships Schema
`mcf_institution_partnerships.csv` tracks academic collaborations with Chinese institutions and
uses the following fields:

- `institution`: Non-Chinese organization involved in the partnership.
- `partner`: Chinese institution in the collaboration.
- `relationship_type`: Nature of the partnership (e.g., joint institute, academic center).
- `source`: Reference supporting the relationship.

## Maintaining Data
- Append records with `python` [`update_datasets.py`](../scripts/update_datasets.py) `<file> <profile_id> <sector> <source>`.
- Generate summary statistics via `python` [`analyze_datasets.py`](../scripts/analyze_datasets.py), which updates `analysis_summary.md`.
- Validation tests for these scripts live under [`../tests/`](../tests/).

## Current Files
- `fake_profiles.csv` – suspected synthetic or compromised LinkedIn profiles.
- `indictments.csv` – legal indictment information tied to MSS activities.
- `mcf_institution_partnerships.csv` – academic partnerships involving Chinese institutions. Fields: `institution`, `partner`, `relationship_type`, `source`.
- `analysis_summary.md` – autogenerated counts by sector for each dataset.

## Future Data Needs
- Include image hashes and message metadata for each profile.
- Track cross-platform links and infrastructure identifiers.

Use these datasets responsibly; entries may contain unverified or sensitive information.
