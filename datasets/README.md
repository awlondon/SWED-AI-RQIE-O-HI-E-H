# Datasets

Structured data supporting analysis lives here.

## Standard Schema
All CSV and JSON datasets use the following fields:

- `profile_id`: Unique identifier for a profile or record.
- `sector`: Industry or target sector linked to the entry.
- `source`: Origin of the data (e.g., OSINT, report, internal).

CSV files require a header row; JSON files should be arrays of objects with these keys.

## Maintaining Data
- Append records with `python scripts/update_datasets.py <file> <profile_id> <sector> <source>`.
- Generate summary statistics via `python scripts/analyze_datasets.py` which updates `analysis_summary.md`.

## Current Files
- `fake_profiles.csv` – suspected synthetic or compromised LinkedIn profiles.
- `indictments.csv` – legal indictment information tied to MSS activities.
- `analysis_summary.md` – autogenerated counts by sector for each dataset.

## Future Data Needs
- Include image hashes and message metadata for each profile.
- Track cross-platform links and infrastructure identifiers.

Use these datasets responsibly; entries may contain unverified or sensitive information.
