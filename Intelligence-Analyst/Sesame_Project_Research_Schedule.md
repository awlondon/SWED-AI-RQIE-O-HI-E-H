# 10-Hour Independent Research Schedule for Sesame Project

All times are in America/Los_Angeles timezone.

| Day / Time (Approx.) | Research Activity | Objective |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Day 1 (1 hour, e.g. 9:00–10:00 AM) | Review existing materials on Sesame in the repository: Open the `LinkedIn/Sesame/RESULTS.md` and related files in the internal GitHub repo to understand what Sesame is, what data it aggregates, and any current findings. | Establish baseline knowledge of Sesame’s scope and how it might involve AI-generated profiles. |
| Day 2 (1 hour) | Search for external sources: Use the web and news archives to find publicly available information on Sesame (if any), AI-generated profiles, and known Chinese influence operations. Note details such as dates, jurisdictions, and names of companies/tools. | Identify gaps between open-source information and internal repository data. |
| Day 3 (1 hour) | Explore AI-avatar providers: Research companies like LIA and Vendisys (highlighted in prior analysis) for connections to Sesame. Document pricing models, services (avatar generation, content creation), and client footprints. | Determine whether Sesame’s outputs could be tied to known shell-company infrastructures. |
| Day 4 (1 hour) | Collect and examine sample profiles/content from Sesame: If Sesame outputs include LinkedIn or social media profiles, gather text samples. Pay attention to style, vocabulary, grammar, and any repetitive patterns. | Create a dataset for linguistic analysis. |
| Day 5 (1 hour) | Perform preliminary linguistic analysis: Read through collected samples and note phrases or idioms that appear unnatural in English. Cross-reference with common Chinese idioms or direct translations to see if literal translations are used. | Identify potential markers of machine translation or culturally inappropriate wording. |
| Day 6 (1 hour) | Engage translation tools and reference corpora: Use Chinese-to-English translation tools (like Google Translate or DeepL) on Chinese equivalents of questionable phrases to check whether the wording matches the suspect English text. Look up idioms in Chinese corpora to understand cultural usage. | Determine whether odd English phrasing stems from direct translation of specific Chinese idioms. |
| Day 7 (1 hour) | Assess AI-generation characteristics: Evaluate whether the writing exhibits traits of AI-generated content (e.g., repetitive sentence structures, lack of personal details, generic corporate language). Compare against known AI-content detection checklists. | Build evidence about whether profiles/content could be AI-generated rather than written by humans. |
| Day 8 (1 hour) | Compile findings on translation patterns: Summarize the recurring linguistic features (e.g. misuse of articles, idiomatic errors, literal translation of proverbs) and provide examples. Note which might be normal in Chinese but unusual in English. | Prepare analysis for final reporting. |
| Day 9 (1 hour) | Cross-reference with external case studies: Relate your findings to known cases of Chinese influence operations (e.g., those mentioned in the critical report analysis). Determine whether similar translation patterns or content-generation tactics were seen. | Contextualize Sesame’s potential role within broader MSS/MPS influence campaigns. |
| Day 10 (1 hour) | Draft research report outline: Organize your observations into sections—introduction, methodology, findings, translation analysis, and recommended actions. Include future research questions (e.g. verifying global targets, exploring other shell companies). | Provide a structured deliverable that can be added to the repository’s `case-studies/sesame/` folder or used to update relevant READMEs. |

This schedule balances discovery, analysis and synthesis phases across ten days, ensuring the analyst spends no more than one hour per day. Adjust specific days and times to fit your availability, but maintain the sequence to build knowledge progressively.
